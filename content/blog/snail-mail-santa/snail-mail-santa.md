It’s that time of year again! Last year we did a holiday sock exchange and this year we are going with thoughtful card exchanges—simple and effective.

After signing up through a form posted in the distraction-den channel, you’ll get emailed a name and address after the form closes on **December 11th**. There’s no need to overthink these cards/notes/letters, as the spirit to this is to give and receive a few kind words, a laugh, a story, and just overall feel a bit more connected during what can be an especially isolating time of year. 

**Here’s a few ideas if you get stuck**:
- A funny story or weird lesson learned from this past year 
- A note of gratitude over something the person has said or done
- A particularly big work win
- Share an interesting fact you came across recently
- Share a holiday tradition you are looking forward to 
- Share your 2025 goals and your dream project scenario 
- A side project idea you’re excited about 
- A bit about the most impactful book you read this year
- Something you are looking forward to in 2025
- General encouragement and well-wishes

I hope you’ll all consider signing up. I, for one, can’t wait to get some more positive, fun, wiggly mail out into the world.
