Itâ€™s week TWO of our winter writing workshop! While last weekâ€™s holiday brought some complications, this week brought many of us a massive snowstorm that closed down schools and work. Despite this, though, everyone pulled through, making adjustments where necessary. January is already proving to be fairly unforgiving for this type of project, but itâ€™s comforting to be doing it amongst friends that are understanding and not afraid to share their concerns and struggles.
