January 1st marked the official kick off of our Winter Wednesdays Writing Workshop. Participants hang out in a special Discord channel and share ideas, offer help, and post our individual work amongst each other. You can find more details on the logistics [here](https://wiggle.work/blog/writing-workshop-2025/). I was a bit nervous that a holiday would be a bad time to start a project like this, but everyone has been enthusiastic and positiveâ€”itâ€™s actually been a great way to bring in a new year.
