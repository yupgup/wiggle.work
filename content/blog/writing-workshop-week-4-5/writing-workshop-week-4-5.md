**WELL DONE** everyone! This was very, very challenging. We get a lot of unexpected life and work stuff pop up in the best of times, but this month was especially taxing for so many. It was so enjoyable to read along with everyoneâ€™s posts and have a group to share struggles with. 

A few takeaways for me are that January is a truly terrible month to commit to something like this, and publishing weekly over a specific day would be much more reasonable. I also found writing for a month around a single theme was not doable, as it would sometimes feel forced. When I let myself write where my head was at, things fell into place nicely. I get so much joy and fulfillment when writing and definitely feel inspired to publish more in 2025 and will continue hanging out in the writing-workshop channelâ€”I hope to see you there still ðŸ§¡
