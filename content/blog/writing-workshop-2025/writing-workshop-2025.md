Itâ€™s time! The Wiggle Work Winter Writing Workshop is upon us again!

One of the community and personal highlights of 2024 was publishing a blog post a day with the same group of people in the month of February. Weâ€™d all hang out in a special channel to share ideas, concerns, get a second set of eyes on something, and encourage one another to keep at it. 

This workshop provided me with a lot of insight into the detriments of writing in isolation. Itâ€™s also a group that takes writing seriously, with equal amounts of passion for professional and personal topics alike. It makes the entire experience so much more fulfilling. Accountability, constructive feedback from peers, encouragement, skill development, and long-lasting momentum are just a few of the significant benefits of writing this way.

We are doing things a little differently for the 2025 second annual writing workshop. Instead of daily in February, weâ€™ll be publishing for each of Januaryâ€™s five Wednesdays. The reasoning here is that committing to publishing an entire blog post each day is NOT exactly sane ðŸ˜… and the desire to make it more inclusive. With more people that can join comes additional perspectives, more topics, and all around more support and cheering.

We had a planning meeting recently to get our heads straight as the time quickly approaches. Here are the highlights in case you werenâ€™t able to make it. 

## Topic Brainstorming
- The **#writing-workshop** crew has been sharing where their heads are at regarding their possible writing topic. There's so much potential hereâ€”stand alone posts, a cohesive series that all comes together at the end, small pieces that add up to something greater, etc. Especially fun ideas so far revolve around resurrecting old posts from a draft folder and writing a chapter each week and publishing a summary with a small PDF book being the final product. 
- There's also flexibility around what and where to write. [Micro blogging](https://micro.blog), social posts, photo-based posting, and code snippets all count as well. We want this to be as enjoyable and *doable* as possibleâ€”no need to overthink it! In fact, some of the best work can be produced this way. 
- The group is eager to help people think through ideas, so post your thoughts in the channel or send me a DM for a one-on-one call and we'll get just the right topic sorted.

## Logistics & Tools
- If you don't currently have a blog, no worries! I used Blot.im last time with great successâ€”up and running in minutes, auto publishing from Dropbox folder. There's also [Pika](https://pika.page/) and a [blog platform list](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms) shared by Nick. For image posts, I've loved [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/). Ultimately, the best tool is whatever doesnâ€™t stand in the way of getting your writing out there. 
- Use the writing channel for anything you needâ€”advice, a second set of eyes, ideas, a sanity check, editing, etc. And share your social accounts so we can spread the love.
- **Each Wednesday starting with January 1st**, we'll publish our work and share the links here in this channel. Please be as encouraging as possible here! Writing can be intimidating and nerve wrecking. We want to foster an environment of excitement and acceptance. 
- We talked about potentially having a special weekly writing coworking session for this. I am very open to it if there is enough interest but I think defaulting to tacking this on to our regular weekly coworking sessions could work well too; let me know!

## Next Steps
- Is there anything you'll be doing this final week to prepare?
- Does anyone need help with ideas or tools?
- Is there someone youâ€™d like to invite to join us?
- Are you not currently a member but would like to change that before that first January Wednesday? *Thereâ€™s still time to apply*!

Please let me know if you have any questions at all. I can't wait to do this again with all of you.
