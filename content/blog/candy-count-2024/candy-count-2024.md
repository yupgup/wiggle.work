It’s CANDY COUNT time again! Last year we counted [wiggly gummy worms](https://mastodon.yupgup.com/@joni/111330878714507284) for [Field Notes](https://mastodon.yupgup.com/@joni/111325353439590139) and this year we are counting Mike and Ikes for a 12 pack of the best fidgets out there: [STIMAGZ](https://stimara.com/collections/stimara-products/products/stimagz-12-pack). These have been my all time favorite go-tos for calls and thinking at my desk.

The candy count is for members only, but luckily you can [join us](https://wiggle.work/) until the winner is picked at noon EST on October 31st. If you’ve won, I’ll DM you in Slack and announce in the distraction-den channel.  

Happy counting!
