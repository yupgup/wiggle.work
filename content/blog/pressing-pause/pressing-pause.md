I will pause Wiggle Work applications for about **a month starting on Saturday, February 8th**. In the spirit of transparency and getting my head straight around the decision, I wanted to write up a couple of notes regarding the reasoning and ultimate goal.

## Regular Housekeeping 

Part of this is that I am overdue for some basic housekeeping and operational considerations. The back of house stuff, even in a small community, can get messy from time to time when this work is not a full-time endeavor. I have found that I manage this best when I shift from growth to thinking through how to enrich the existing state of thingsâ€”so, leaving room to slow down.

I also have an increasingly convoluted Notion board to organize, some automation to consider and implement, and a new onboarding strategy to map out and test. So, nothing glamorous, but all important. Itâ€™s just me on this end of things and sometimes that means I manage these files and spreadsheets like no one is watchingâ€”because no one is!

## Financial Considerations 

Wiggle Work is a labor of love but also involves me using my personal money in the form of the Discord server boosts, shipping, and fun prizes. Iâ€™ve always been so happy to do this, and will continue to, but the scope or structure will have to change fairly drastically to be sustainable.

Every once in a while there are some kind, generous folks that contribute to our [Ko-fi account](https://ko-fi.com/wigglework). Itâ€™s *greatly* appreciated but doesnâ€™t cover base operational costs. I need time to think through impactful but realistic options here and weigh this against what sort of time investment I can put into Wiggle Work in the future based on the solution. 

Iâ€™d love to fully commit more resources to this space that I believe to be so important and influential, so I need time to consider a more solid financial plan. And if I hit dead ends here, I need to be honest with myself about what that means for my existing resources I can spare. 

## Reflection 

Iâ€™m in a separate group for community builders and weâ€™ve had a lot of motivating conversations lately, with a larger theme of slowing down and reflecting before taking action. Part of this reflection involves reevaluating goals, both personally and on a group level, and changing the current trajectory when necessary based on how much of this is not overlapping. I want to make sure I understand my *current* goals and hopes, how it compares to where I started, and what this all looks like from now on. 

Iâ€™ve done this before when leading other communities and itâ€™s led to some incredible, energizing changes, clarity, and resolutions. For instance, depending on the specific goals of course, bringing on an engaged co-organizer, getting sponsors, prioritizing new events, updating purpose statements, or retiring on a good note are all things Iâ€™ve carried out in the past to start down a new path.

Honesty and transparency are core values I work hard to uphold personally and professionally, and I simply wanted to take a couple minutes to let everyone in on why there is a temporary pause on applications. Our small, cozy Discord space will still be full of chatter and calls, and Iâ€™ll be back with another blog post when I get these things sorted out in my head and on paper. 

See you are around if youâ€™re an active member, and see you in March if you are a future member ðŸ§¡
