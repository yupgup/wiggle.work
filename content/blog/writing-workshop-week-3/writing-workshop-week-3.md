Itâ€™s week THREE of our winter writing workshop, which officially means we are more than halfway through it! Some lessons learned this week include: taking a blog post pic before writing can help energize the writing process, and writing within the constraints of a theme can be especially challenging since it wonâ€™t always be where your head is at.
