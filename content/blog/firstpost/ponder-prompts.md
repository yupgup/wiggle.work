Ponder Prompts are daily weekday discussion themes and they are the heart of Wiggle Work. Successful, engaged communities will not happen by chance, and these prompts have helped us get to know each other in a unique, fast-tracked, fun, and genuine way. I’ve tracked most of these since the start of the community in August 2023 and have been housing them in a master, living 39+ page (and growing) document with a link to the Discord discussion for new members to look back on.

Having joined other online communities in the past, there seems to be too much pressure and uncertainty about how to contribute each day. It’s also intimidating as a new member since everyone else already seems fairly ingrained into the space—these prompts work directly to combat these feelings of isolation. Whether in a community setting or professional one-on-ones where rapport building and connecting are crucial, these discussion themes foster stronger online teams through bridging an inherit communication gap and establishing bonds.  

You’ll get to know important things about a group’s talents, skills, personalities, values, and how they like their toast.

The purchase price here secures lifelong access to the living Google document, where we will continue to add new weekday prompts. Funds raised go directly to helping cover our server costs, shipping for snail mail to welcome new members, and special events.

**You can get access to Ponder Prompts on our [Ko-fi page here](https://ko-fi.com/s/07d2c5b8ce)—we appreciate your support**.
